# If you want to load Amethyst in global namespace to be able not to prepend
# classes with name of modules they are in (for example, Core::BaseController),
# you can load all modules into global namespace with next code:
# require "amethyst/all" (i.e. App.new instead of Core::App.new, etc.)

require "amethyst"

# Controller class. The name of controller must be "NameController",
# and it needs to be inherited from BaseController
class IndexController < Base::Controller
  actions :hello, :bye

  # Controller action. It gets request of Http::Requst as an argument.
  # For now, each controller should return Http::Response by itself.
  def hello
    html "<p>Hello, you're asked a #{request.method} #{request.path}</p> \n
          <a href='/bye'>Visit <b>bye</b> action</a>"
  end

  def bye
    html "<p>Bye!We hope you will come back</p>"
  end

  # Method "actions" must be provided by each controller of your application.
  # It lets app to know which methods of your contoller are actions.
  # The synopsys is add :action_name
end

# Middleware are implemented as classes. Middleware class inherits from
# Core::Middleware::BaseMiddleware (or, just type "BaseMiddleware" if you  are
# using "amethyst/all"), and should have the "call" method.
class TimeLogger < Middleware::Base

  # This one will be called when app gets request. It accepts Http::Request
  def call(request)
    t_req    = Time.now
    response = @app.call(request)
    t_res    = Time.now
    elapsed  = (t_res - t_req).to_f*1000
    string   = "%.4f ms" % elapsed
    response.body += "<hr>"+string
    response
  end
end

# You can describe your apps with a classes
class TestApp < Base::App
  settings.environment = "development"
  # Rails-like approach to describe routes.It consists of path
  # and string "controller_name#action_name"
  # You can specify params to be captured:
  # get "/users/:id", "users#show"
  routes.draw do
    all "/all", "index#hello"
    get "/",    "index#hello"
    get "/bye", "index#bye"

    # After you defined a controller, you have to register it in app with
    # app.routes.register(NameController) where NameController is the class name
    # of your controller.
    register IndexController
  end

  # Middleware registering
  # use TimeLogger
end

# App creating
app = TestApp.new
app.serve
